== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin really work with any block? =
Yes! However, not all block types are enabled by default. Visibility controls are only provided to blocks that can be added directly to a page/post by the block inserter. Therefore, some specialized blocks, such as child blocks, are not included by default. An example being the individual Column block that is part of the larger Columns block.

That said, you can enable Full Control Mode in the plugin settings. This removes all restrictions and adds visibility controls to every block. You probably will not need Full Control Mode, but it is there if you do.

Furthermore, while this plugin was designed to be compatible with all blocks, the WordPress ecosystem is ever expanding. If you find a conflict with a certain block, please let us know in the plugin support forum and we will investigate. We are committed to bringing visibility control to *every* block.

= Can Block Visibility be used with any WordPress theme? =
Yup, this plugin is not theme specific. You just need to be running the latest version of WordPress and be utilizing the Block Editor. 

= Will more visibility controls be added in the future? =
Yes, and if you have a specific idea of what you would like to see, please submit a feature request in the plugin support forum on WordPress.org.

= Does this plugin work with the upcoming full site editing functionality? =
Since full site editing is still in the development phase, this plugin does not currently work with this new functionality. However, Block Visibility was designed with full site editing in mind. There are tons of interesting applications for visibility control and we plan to get the plugin ready for full site implementation in the coming months.
